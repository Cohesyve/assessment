## Cohesyve Aseessment 
This project is designed to leverage a neo4j graph dataset that includes detailed information about companies and venture capitalists. 
The objective is to develop a sophisticated web-based tool that harnesses this dataset to provide valuable insights and facilitate informed decision-making for its users. 
By utilizing the relationships and connections inherent in the dataset, the tool will enable venture capitalists to discover potential investment opportunities and related companies, while entrepreneurs can identify relevant venture capitalists, competitors, and potential collaborators. 
The ultimate goal is to create a platform that offers dynamic exploration and visualization of the data, helping users navigate and make strategic decisions in the investment and business landscape.
